# ML final project  

### This project was created to create boosted gradient trees, train them, and compare  
### them to regular decision trees. Boosted trees work by creating many decision trees  
### but after making one tree, the next tree is created based off the lose and mistakes  
### of the previous tree. This pattern is continued until an early stop is activated or  
### until the iteration ends.  

# Setting up the data  

### First you start by spliting up the csv file into training and testing files. This  
### is done by adding the csv filename into the split_data file created by Curtis Larson.  

# Making a GB Tree  
*Optimize hyperparameters in gradient boosted function  
*Hyperparameters can be tuned using the tuner  
*Run the program to display the results of the training
